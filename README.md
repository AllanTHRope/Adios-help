# Adios Help
### Help Adios users by translating the help section of the app in your own language

Adios, the first free ad blocker for iOS, will be on the App Store very soon. It means one thing: a lot of people like my mom and maybe yours will start using Adios. This is a great opportunity to change the Web but these users have two problems:
- They don't necessarily speak English.
- They have difficulties to use something they don't know.

To help them, Adios has been developed to be as straightforward as possible. There's even a help section:

</p>

This help section needs to be translated so that everybody can start blocking ads and I'm counting on you to help me.

### What are the languages needed?
Let's start with two basics:
- German
- Spanish

If you're able to translate Adios in another language: please do it! 

### Here is the procedure to translate Adios:
- Clone the repo.
- Copy/paste english.html and create [language].html
- Translate the text, not the HTML divs around it.
- Commit.

That's it! Thanks to you users, young and old, will be able to start blocking ads this September.

Thank you for being here, Adios wouldn't exist without you.
